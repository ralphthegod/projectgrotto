# Project Grotto

Project Grotto is an Android game development project that leverages the power of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern. The project is written in Java and built using the Gradle build system.

## The Game

Project Grotto is a roguelike dungeon-crawler where higher-level characters defeat lower-level ones and absorb their levels.

- **Progression**: Collecting valuable items and defeating enemies are the primary mechanics for progression.
- **Accelerometer-based Movement**: The movement mechanic requires good control skills to avoid stronger enemies and dangerous obstacles.
- **Procedural Level Generation**: Each level is entirely randomly generated, including the treasures and monsters populating it.
