## The Game

Project Grotto is a roguelike dungeon-crawler where players must explore a deep and dangerous dungeon. The game features several key mechanics:

- **Progression**: Collecting valuable items and defeating enemies are the primary mechanics for progression.
- **Accelerometer-based Movement**: The movement mechanic requires good control skills to avoid enemies and obstacles.
- **Procedural Level Generation**: Each level is entirely randomly generated, including the treasures and monsters populating it.
- **AI Decision Trees**: The behavior of enemies and other NPCs is governed by decision trees.
